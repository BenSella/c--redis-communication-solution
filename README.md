#Redis projcet
This project provides a Redis manager solution designed to help developers interact 
with a Redis server by offering utilities to write, retrieve, and execute commands on Redis. 
It includes two main components:

Real Redis Integration: Uses the StackExchange.Redis library to connect to a real Redis server, 
allowing for high-performance data storage and retrieval.
Mock (Fake) Redis Implementation: Provides a fake Redis manager for testing purposes, 
enabling developers to simulate Redis operations without requiring a real Redis server. 
This is particularly useful for unit testing, using xUnit as the testing framework.

Real Redis Integration:

Connect to an actual Redis server.
Perform standard Redis operations like writing, retrieving, and deleting data.
Utilize the StackExchange.Redis library for robust and efficient Redis communication.
Fake Redis Implementation:

Simulate Redis operations in a testing environment.
Provides the ability to test Redis-dependent functionalities without the need for an actual Redis instance.
Ensures unit tests are isolated, reliable, and easy to run.
Testing:

Unit tests using xUnit framework to ensure the Redis manager works as expected.
Tests the fake Redis manager to simulate Redis behavior and validate the functionality of your application.

Components Explained
Utils/Interfaces/IRedisManager.cs:

An interface defining the contract for Redis operations.
Ensures that both the real and fake Redis managers implement the same set of methods.
Promotes loose coupling and allows easy swapping of the real and fake Redis managers in the application.
Utils/FakeRedisManager.cs:

A mock implementation of the IRedisManager interface.
Simulates Redis operations for testing purposes, such as storing data in an in-memory dictionary.
Allows you to test your application's Redis-dependent features without connecting to a real Redis server.
Useful for running unit tests in environments where a real Redis server is not available or practical.
Utils/RedisManager.cs:

The real implementation of the IRedisManager interface.
Uses the StackExchange.Redis library to connect to and interact with a real Redis server.
Supports standard Redis operations like setting and getting key-value pairs, executing commands, and managing data in Redis.
Ensures high performance and scalability by leveraging Redis as a fast, in-memory data store.
Program.cs:

The main entry point for the application.
Demonstrates the usage of the Redis manager by initializing it and performing some basic operations.
Helps in understanding how to integrate and use the Redis manager in an application.
XunitTestRedis/FakeRedisManagerTest.cs:

Contains unit tests for the FakeRedisManager.
Ensures that the fake Redis manager correctly simulates Redis operations.
Helps verify the behavior of Redis-dependent functionalities in isolation.
Uses the xUnit testing framework to write and execute the tests.
Usage
Real Redis Integration:

The RedisManager class uses the StackExchange.Redis package to connect to a Redis server.
You can perform operations like setting, getting, and deleting keys, executing Redis commands, and more.
This is ideal for production environments where you need to interact with an actual Redis server for caching, data storage, and other use cases.
Fake Redis Implementation:

The FakeRedisManager class provides a simulated Redis environment.
Use this class when writing unit tests to mimic Redis operations without needing a live server.
This ensures your tests are isolated, quick, and can be run without external dependencies.
Testing with xUnit:

The FakeRedisManagerTest class contains unit tests for the fake Redis manager.
Use these tests to verify that the fake manager behaves as expected and your application's logic works correctly with Redis-like behavior.
Run the tests using xUnit to ensure the reliability and correctness of your Redis integration.
